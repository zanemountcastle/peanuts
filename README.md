# Peanuts

Peanuts is an application that allows for individual honors-system based scoring.
This application was originally built and customized for the [Peanuts](https://www.pagat.com/patience/nerts.html)
card game, a family favorite. It allows each user to control only his or her
score, but allows for all users in the game to view the scores of their opponents
at any time. More than anything, however, Peanuts is a personal project I embarked
upon to familiarize myself with the Meteor ecosystem.
